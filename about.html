            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                Currently working on <a href="https://vaults.fyi/" target="_blank">vaults.fyi</a>. Permissionless DeFi infra is cool... Making it accessible is even cooler. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not <a href="/posts/">writing</a> or doing stuff on <a href="https://dune.com/tt_tyler" target="_blank">Dune</a>, you can catch me surfing, practicing my espresso making, or studying world history. In my past, I worked as a data analyst/PM at mutliple startups and in investment banking before that. I studied Engineering Science + Econ at Vanderbilt.
