# Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I'm a co-founder of [vaults.fyi](https://vaults.fyi/), where we're working to bring transparent, permissionless web3 financial applications to the masses.

Read out some of my writings [here](/posts/) and find my analytics work at [Dune](https://dune.com/tt_tyler).

I like to surf, make espresso, and study history. I studied Engineering Science and Economics in undergrad. In my youth, I raced go karts competitively and was a Latin nerd.

Get in touch with me via DM on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/0x7477/).
